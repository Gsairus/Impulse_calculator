Create a professional scientific banner for a Lightning Impulse Current Calculator web application.

━━━ TECHNICAL CONTEXT ━━━
This app calculates lightning and surge current waveforms according to IEC 62305-1 standards.
Target users: Electrical engineers, lightning protection specialists, researchers.

━━━ PRIMARY VISUAL ELEMENTS ━━━

1. WAVEFORM DISPLAY (Most Important):
   - Show an accurate 10/350 µs lightning impulse waveform curve
   - Sharp exponential rise to peak at ~10 µs
   - Long exponential decay tail to ~350 µs
   - Clean line graph style (like oscilloscope trace)
   - Graph should be prominent and scientifically accurate

2. LIGHTNING SYMBOL:
   - Stylized lightning bolt, not cartoonish
   - Integrated subtly with the waveform (behind or beside it)
   - Electric blue color (#3B82F6)
   - Sharp, angular, technical design

3. GRID BACKGROUND:
   - Subtle measurement grid (like graph paper or oscilloscope)
   - Semi-transparent, not distracting
   - Gives scientific/technical feel
   - Dark background with light grid lines

━━━ COLOR PALETTE ━━━
- Background: Deep navy (#0f172a) or dark charcoal (#1a1a1a)
- Primary waveform line: Electric blue (#3B82F6) - bright, glowing effect
- Secondary accents: Light blue (#60a5fa) for highlights
- Grid lines: Dark gray (#1e293b) - very subtle
- Text-ready areas: Leave space with good contrast

━━━ COMPOSITION & LAYOUT ━━━

FOR BANNER (1200x300px):
- Waveform spans horizontally across center
- Lightning bolt on left or right side
- Grid background throughout
- Clean, wide format for web header
- Professional and uncluttered

FOR ICON (512x512px):
- Centered lightning bolt
- Waveform arc wrapping around or behind it
- Grid in background
- High contrast for small display sizes
- Recognizable at 32x32px

━━━ STYLE REQUIREMENTS ━━━
- Modern technical illustration style
- NOT photorealistic, NOT 3D rendered
- Flat/semi-flat design with subtle glow effects
- Clean vector-style graphics
- Scientific precision, not decorative
- No text or typography (leave space for app name)
- High contrast for readability
- Professional engineering aesthetic

━━━ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ━━━
- High resolution (300 DPI minimum)
- Clean edges and sharp lines
- Suitable for both light and dark mode websites
- Works at multiple scales (icon to banner)
- No complex gradients that don't scale well

━━━ MOOD & TONE ━━━
Professional | Precise | Scientific | Modern | Trustworthy | Technical Excellence

━━━ AVOID ━━━
❌ Cartoon style or clip art look
❌ Stock photo lightning bolts
❌ Overly decorative or artistic interpretations
❌ Busy compositions with too many elements
❌ Low contrast or muddy colors
❌ Generic electrical symbols
❌ 3D rendered or photorealistic styles

━━━ REFERENCE CONCEPT ━━━
Think: High-end oscilloscope display + technical engineering software + modern web design
Similar to: MATLAB interface aesthetics, electrical engineering textbook diagrams, precision measurement instruments

━━━ OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS ━━━
Two versions needed:
1. Wide banner (1200x300px) for web header
2. Square icon (512x512px) for app icon/favicon

Both should share same color palette and visual language but adapted for their specific format.
